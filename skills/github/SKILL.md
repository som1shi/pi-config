# GitHub (gh CLI)

Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations. Never use the GitHub MCP server.

## Common Operations

Read-only PR and CI inspection:

- `gh pr list`, `gh pr view <number>`
- `gh pr view <number> --json number,url,state,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,baseRefOid`
- `gh pr checks <number> --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link`
- `gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast` when checks are pending
- `gh run list`, `gh run view <id>`, `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, `gh run watch <id>`
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` for PR review comments
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments` for PR discussion comments
- `gh issue list`, `gh issue view <number>`
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/...` for other read-only API queries

## PR Evidence Identity

For a readiness claim or review that depends on current PR content:

1. Select the target PR, then resolve and retain its number, URL, state, head name/OID, and base name/OID with the `gh pr view <number> --json` command above.
2. Use the retained PR number for every subsequent metadata, diff, check, and review query; gather the applicable evidence for that observed identity.
3. Immediately before the final claim or an authorized claim-bearing post, resolve the same fields again using the retained PR number.
4. If the state or any head/base name or OID changed, do not make the claim or post. Reassess the PR state, discard the affected PR-content-dependent evidence, recapture the applicable evidence for the new identity, and repeat the identity check before proceeding.
5. Report the final identity as `PR <number> <url>; head <name>@<OID>; base <name>@<OID>` with the result.

This is an observational freshness check, not an atomic lock on the PR. It applies only when a conclusion depends on PR content; metadata-only inspection and non-PR reviews do not gain this gate.

Mutating operations require the user to explicitly ask for that exact action. One requested GitHub mutation does not authorize another. This skill documents command categories; it does not permit any mutation blocked by AGENTS.md or project rules:

- creating a PR with `gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md`
- editing a PR description/body
- posting a PR comment
- submitting a PR review
- creating an inline PR review comment
- creating an issue
- posting an issue comment

## Workflow Routing

Use the existing owner for the requested work:

- **Issue drafting, triage, or revision:** `github-issues` owns evidence, scope, duplicates, and completion criteria. Routine issue lookup stays here.
- **PR preparation or review:** `review` owns review method and reviewer selection; `behavioral-proof` selects evidence. Reuse review and checks still valid for the current change rather than starting another review for a small description or handoff draft.
- **Outgoing PR review comments:** `github-pr-comments` turns validated findings into proposed comments and governs their authorized posting.
- **PR feedback or CI fixes:** `iterate-pr` owns an authorized fix cycle. Evaluate feedback against current code, recheck the original concern after a fix, and refresh affected evidence. Draft useful replies without mechanically replying to every comment.
- **Author-to-human review request:** `pr-review-handoff` drafts the requested message; it does not dispatch agents or request reviewers on GitHub.

Keep PR checks, static proof, and representative live evidence distinct. Suggest a live check only when it would materially strengthen the selected proof and is within the active authorization boundary. Name material unverified behavior instead of implying that passing checks cover it.

These routes do not authorize posts, replies, thread resolution, issue attachment, reviewer assignment, or any other GitHub mutation. Show proposed external changes and follow the exact-action approval rules above.

## PR Description Format

Use this format when drafting PR text or when the user explicitly asks to update a PR description/body:

```
## What changed
Concise summary. Key files/areas affected.

## Why
Motivation, context, problem being solved.

## How tested
Tests added/updated, manual checks, commands run.
```

When a PR is large or noisy, add reviewer guidance:

- separate core behavior files from generated, mechanical, or formatting-only files;
- name the best reviewer entry points;
- call out risky behavior changes, migration/order dependencies, rollout notes, and test coverage;
- recommend splitting the PR instead of polishing the description when the diff is too large or mixed to review safely.

## Rules

- Always use `--body-file` for multi-line PR bodies (avoids shell escaping issues).
- You may update a PR description/body, post a PR comment, submit a PR review, or create an inline PR review comment only when the user explicitly asks for that exact action.
- NEVER push, merge, close, reopen, label, assign, request reviewers, change PR bases, or create PRs unless the user explicitly asks for that exact operation.
- Check `gh auth status` if operations fail.
