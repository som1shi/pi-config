description: Automated PR iteration loop — fix CI failures or review feedback, present changes, perform exactly authorized Git updates when requested, then monitor and repeat. Use when asked to "iterate on PR", "fix CI", "PR is failing", "address review comments", or continuously iterate on fixes until checks pass.

# Iterate PR

Automate the fix -> present -> authorized Git update -> monitor -> check -> fix cycle for PRs. Git mutations require exact user authorization and scope.

## Workflow

1. **Check current state**: load and follow `github`; select the target PR and start its PR evidence identity snapshot. Use `gh pr checks <number> --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link` with the retained PR number as the source of truth for PR-attached checks.
2. **Identify failures**: read CI logs, PR review comments, and issue discussion comments. Extract the first actionable error before fixing.
3. **Fix issues**: the parent normally implements validated fixes. Use write workers only for at least two independent concurrent areas under exclusive internal file ownership, with the parent owning one area.
4. **Verify locally**: run the same safe focused check or nearest local equivalent that CI runs.
5. **Review**: enter the normal `manager-workflow` review stage for nontrivial fixes; automatically apply only validated local fixes inside the approved behavior while material progress continues.
6. **Present changes**: show the behavior fixed, effective change, review disposition, and validation evidence to the user.
7. **Authorized Git update**: when the user explicitly authorizes the exact staging paths, commit, and push target, the agent may perform those Git mutations. Otherwise provide the exact command for the user to run.
8. **Monitor after push**: after the pushed head is visible on the retained PR number, start a new PR evidence identity snapshot before monitoring. Use `gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast` when checks are pending, then re-run `gh pr checks <number> --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link` for the retained PR to inspect the full check set. Apply the `github` identity recheck before reporting PR readiness.
9. **Repeat** if new failures appear and the next round has a concrete evidence-producing action.

## Rules

- Never stage, commit, or push without explicit user authorization for the exact paths, commit, and target.
- Use `gh pr checks` rather than GitHub Actions-only commands when judging overall PR readiness; PRs can have non-Actions checks.
- Fix one category of failure at a time (lint, then tests, then type errors).
- If a failure is unclear, investigate before fixing.
- If a failure looks flaky, ask the user to retry or re-run it once when that requires a mutating GitHub action, then report the flake evidence instead of looping indefinitely.
- Continue only while each iteration has a concrete evidence-producing action and makes material progress. Stop and report when clean, blocked, approval-gated, or stalled/repeating; do not rely on a fixed iteration count.
